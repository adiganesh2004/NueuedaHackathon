🗓️ 4-Week Agile Plan (2 Sprints, each 2 weeks)
Each sprint is focused on delivering a working feature set that can be deployed and tested on a local OpenShift/Minikube cluster.

✅ Assumptions
You’re working solo or in a small team.

Basic cluster (Minikube/OpenShift) + MongoDB is available.

Using kopf (Python) to build the operator.

📅 Sprint Plan
📌 Sprint 1 (Week 1–2): Core Functionality
🎯 Sprint Goal:
Build and test a basic operator that connects to MongoDB, reads queued records, assigns them to workers, and performs basic scale-up/down logic.

🧩 Sprint Backlog Tasks:
Task ID	Task Description	Type	Priority
T1	Set up Python operator skeleton with Kopf	Dev	🔴 High
T2	Add MongoDB connectivity and record polling	Dev	🔴 High
T3	Implement logic to detect number of queued records	Dev	🔴 High
T4	Deploy dummy worker pods manually for testing	Ops	🟡 Medium
T5	Implement pod scaling logic (via Deployments)	Dev	🔴 High
T6	Assign records to worker pods (based on capacity)	Dev	🔴 High
T7	Deploy operator to local OpenShift/minikube cluster	Ops	🟡 Medium
T8	Write basic unit test for queue reading logic	QA	🟢 Low

📊 Sprint Deliverables:
Operator deployed to test cluster.

Queue monitoring + scaling logic works.

Record assignment working for test pods.

📌 Sprint 2 (Week 3–4): Stability, Tracking & Cleanup
🎯 Sprint Goal:
Enhance the operator to persist and track record state, handle completion and failures, and support basic observability.

🧩 Sprint Backlog Tasks:
Task ID	Task Description	Type	Priority
T9	Track assigned records in MongoDB with status updates	Dev	🔴 High
T10	Add logic to cleanup completed records from queue	Dev	🔴 High
T11	Add minimum pod count safeguard (do not scale below X)	Dev	🟡 Medium
T12	Implement basic retry or failure marking mechanism	Dev	🟡 Medium
T13	Add logging and status conditions to operator logs	Dev	🟡 Medium
T14	Deploy real worker pods that process assigned records	Dev	🔴 High
T15	Integration testing: simulate queue spikes, pod crashes	QA	🔴 High
T16	Package & push operator image to container registry	DevOps	🟡 Medium
T17	Update RBAC & operator deployment YAMLs	Ops	🟢 Low

📊 Sprint Deliverables:
Operator reliably handles queue assignment and completion.

Autoscaling thresholds (min/max pods) enforced.

Processed records tracked and cleaned up.

📈 Weekly Breakdown
Week	Activities
Week 1	T1–T3 (Setup, MongoDB connection, polling logic)
Week 2	T4–T8 (Scaling logic, basic record assignment, test cluster deployment)
Week 3	T9–T12 (Tracking, retries, cleanup logic)
Week 4	T13–T17 (Logging, real workers, tests, packaging, deployment)

📋 Optional Agile Artifacts
✅ Definition of Done (DoD) for each feature:
Code committed and pushed.

Deployed and working in test cluster.

Unit test or manual test completed.

Logs show expected behavior.

✅ Sample Daily Standup (Solo or Team):
What did I do yesterday?

What will I do today?

Any blockers?
